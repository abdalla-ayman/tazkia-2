This research focused on the design and development of Tazkia, an AI-powered Android application aimed at supporting the Islamic principle of lowering the gaze through gender-based image filtering. The study was motivated by the increasing dominance of visual content on mobile platforms and the lack of tools that address religiously sensitive requirements beyond conventional content moderation approaches.

The research demonstrated that modern computer vision and machine learning techniques can be effectively integrated into mobile environments to address culturally and religiously specific needs. By utilizing lightweight AI models through MediaPipe and TensorFlow Lite, the system was able to detect and classify human figures in real time while maintaining acceptable usability and system responsiveness on most modern Android devices. However, achieving stable and persistent blur rendering across consecutive frames proved challenging due to synchronization limitations between screen capture, inference, and overlay rendering pipelines.

Through systematic system design, implementation, and evaluation, this research addressed an important gap in existing content filtering technologies. Unlike traditional filters that focus primarily on explicit or inappropriate material, Tazkia introduces a context-aware and value-driven approach aligned with Islamic teachings. This contribution highlights the importance of designing technological solutions that respect ethical, cultural, and religious values alongside technical performance.

Several limitations were identified during the study, including variability in performance across different hardware capabilities, reduced robustness in complex visual scenarios, and restrictions imposed by Android system permissions and application store policies. These limitations do not diminish the contribution of the research; rather, they provide clear direction for future enhancement and optimization.

Future work may involve incorporating object tracking and temporal smoothing techniques to improve blur persistence and reduce flickering artifacts. Additional extensions could include support for video content, further optimization using more advanced yet lightweight AI models, expanded user customization options, and exploration of cross-platform implementations. Moreover, comprehensive user studies could be conducted to quantitatively evaluate long-term usability, comfort, and acceptance among diverse user groups.

In conclusion, Tazkia represents a meaningful contribution to the field of mobile content filtering by combining technical innovation with ethical and religious considerations. This research demonstrates that mobile AI applications can be designed not only for efficiency and accuracy, but also to support deeply held values. The work provides a solid foundation for future research and development in culturally aware and ethically aligned digital technologies.
